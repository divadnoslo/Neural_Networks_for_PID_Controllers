# Neural_Networks_for_PID_Controllers
A project that looks into tuning PID controllers via a variety of neural network strategies.  Ensure to read the READ_ME files for proper set-up of the code in MATLAB.  

Each folder contains one method of tuning PID controllers via neural network methods and genetic algorithms.  
Each folder is intended to run a stand-alone block of code.  
Follow the directions in the READ_ME of each folder to properly set-up the environment in MATLAB.
